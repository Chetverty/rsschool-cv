            <h2>Personal summary</h2>
            <p>I'm a new player at the IT-field, recently I've been working on other stuff so I decided to change my routine and try something new. As it turned out it's not so easy but I'm not bored yet. I'm looking forward to get a lot of knowledge at RSS, to meet people who share my interests and as soon as I will be well-trained I anticipate to get hired. I'm always ready for some new experience though there could appear some impediments and difficulties.</p>
